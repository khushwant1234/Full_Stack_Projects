my full stack projects
Hi to anyone reading this, Khushwant here!
Excited to share my latest project - a responsive clone of the Spotify website built using HTML5 and CSS3 [pure vanilla CSS].
Check out the screen recording showcasing the various features I added!
I am an aspiring full stack developer, I've already learned basics of html5 and Css3, I am currently learning JavaScript.
I wish to join a team where I'll learn more about Web-Dev and Tech in general.
Please give me an opportunity [or I'll cry :( ] and I promise you that I'll give it my best!! :)
